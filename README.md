# CodeLeap

https://codeleap-psi.vercel.app/

This project is to test my skills with React and the use of Redux in a more simplified way.

The test is for junior devs, but as I didn't find any aimed at a more mid-level profile, I decided to do it with a few more features.

In a more complex project I would use redux-saga to handle requests.

- Logout
- Persistent login with redux-persist
- Redux Toolkit
- Unitary tests
- 100% test coverage
